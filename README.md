<h1> Engeto Python </h1>

Repo serves as a source of knowlegde/history check for (succesfully completed) Engeto course focused on Python (Data part is in its own repo). Hence here are notes and exercises done during lectures and home study session as well as 3 projects.
1st one was focused on really simple text analyses and overall (imo) doing something on our own. 2nd one mitigated a small game development focused on random aspects of the gameplay. 3rd project had more universal use in the sense that
it scraped data from czech election result webpage in a district chosen by user and generated excel file with result details.

Honestly Python was much more than I expected, plus it was more fun than the data part (imo not bcs data are boring but just the focus seemed a bit plain). Hence now choosing the path whether to take additional extending courses (e.g. Pandas, 
Numpy, MatPlot, ..., which were unfortunately not included in data + python engeto course) or work on my own project (e.g. currently thinking about either some kind of investment tracker or car ownership (cost) tracker).
